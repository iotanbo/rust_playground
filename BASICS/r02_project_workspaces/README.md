# PROJECT STRUCTURE WITH WORKSPACES

! For more info, see `r01_project_structure` readme.

## SUMMARY
It's a viable solution, especially for large projects.
Results in:
+ cleaner project structure
+ better decoupling between units

!But VS Code context help becomes buggy, for better development experience
as on January 2021 I recommend using Single Package Project.
